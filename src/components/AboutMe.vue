    <h2> About </h2>

    <h4> Welcome to the Wall of Fame. This wall is a reminder for the history of the Internet Computer. </h4>

    <div clas="paragh">
    <p> Write a short message and in 20 years you will remind this moment with nostalgia. 
        You can write about what you hope the Internet Computer will bring to humanity. 
        You can also write about ... anything. 
        (Except hate speech, racism, insults...) </p>

    <p> I engage myself to keep this canister alive and manage it for the moment.
        I also engage myself to make this wall a public internet service as soon a I am able to do it. </p>
